Peristaltic pumps are high-precision positive displacement dosing pumps used in various chemical\pharmaceutical industries. The project was aimed at researching and designing a smart peristaltic pump which is programmable\customisable for different industries by controlling the entire system with a microprocessor and deploying embedded software which realizes various smart features like - intuitive UX, precise software control reducing human interference, process automation for repetitive tasks reducing manual effort, enabling communication with other devices, remote operation, read\write configuration file for mass replication, smart algorithms for automatic calibration, performance analysis and automatic error correction. A fully functional prototype of this smart peristaltic pump was developed by a team of 4 engineering students in collaboration with MuRhoPye Scientific Company, Mysuru.
